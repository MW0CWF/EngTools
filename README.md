Miscellaneous Engineering software tools, mainly for 8 bit Acorn computers.

Most have been developed to solve a specific objective and may not function
in the same manner when applied to other environments.

You are always responsible for validating the result. I will try to fix
errors that are identified and communicated to me but the tools are
supplied without any form of warantee.

That said I hope you find something useful here.
